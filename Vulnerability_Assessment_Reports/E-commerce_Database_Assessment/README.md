# Vulnerability Assessment - E-commerce Database

For the Portuguese version, see [README.pt-br.md](README.pt-br.md).

## Project Summary

This project involves performing a qualitative vulnerability assessment for a simulated e-commerce company's database server. The primary goal was to identify and evaluate security risks associated with a critical vulnerability: the database being openly accessible to the public internet. Acting as a newly hired cybersecurity analyst, I conducted this assessment to understand potential impacts on business operations and propose necessary security measures.

## Scenario

The scenario describes an e-commerce company storing customer and business data on a remote MySQL database server. This server, crucial for operations and marketing, has been exposed to the public internet since the company's launch three years ago. This direct public access represents a significant security vulnerability.

## Objective

The main objective was to conduct a vulnerability assessment to articulate the risks posed by the publicly accessible database server to company stakeholders and to outline a remediation plan based on standard security frameworks.

## Demonstrated Skills

* Vulnerability Identification and Analysis
* Threat Modeling (Identifying Threat Sources and Events)
* Risk Assessment (Qualitative - Likelihood and Severity Scoring)
* Security Control Recommendation
* Understanding of Security Frameworks (NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 basics)
* Report Writing and Communication of Technical Risks

## Approach

Risks considered the data storage and management methods of the business. The likelihood of a threat occurrence and the impact of these potential events were weighed against the risks to day-to-day operational needs. Based on a qualitative assessment, the public access vulnerability to the database makes the organization particularly susceptible to outside threats. This easy access significantly raises the likelihood of outside threat actor exploitation, going from the practice of techniques to deliberate sabotage of this company's reputation and operations. Additionally, the lack of robust access controls and audit logs raises the risk of internal mistakes or even malicious actions by employees.

## Key Risks Identified

Based on the assessment, the following key risks were identified:

| Threat Source | Threat Event                                                            | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :------- | :--- |
| Hacker        | Can install software designed to collect (sniff) network traffic. A “man-in-the-middle” attack is also possible. | 3          | 3        | 9    |
| Employee      | Can alter or delete data that is critical to day-to-day business operations. | 2          | 3        | 6    |
| Competitor    | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration                           | 1          | 3        | 3    |

*(Note: The assessment focused on key risks related to the primary vulnerability, but also considered other potential threats as per standard practice.)*

## Security Recommendations

To mitigate the identified risks, the following security controls were recommended:

* **Implementation of Authentication, Authorization, and Auditing (AAA) mechanisms:** This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    * **Justification:** AAA controls, along with strong passwords, RBAC, and MFA, highly mitigates the risk of an actor stealing the identity of an employee or conducting actions posing as one, thereby protecting against both external and internal unauthorized access/actions.
* **IP Allow-listing:** Restrict database access to only approved IP addresses, such as those from corporate offices.
    * **Justification:** This makes it significantly more difficult for an outside threat actor to connect to the database by denying any connection attempts from unapproved external IPs immediately.
* **Encryption of data in motion using TLS:** Ensure all data transmitted to and from the database is encrypted using TLS.
    * **Justification:** Encrypting data in motion mitigates risks like "man-in-the-middle" attacks, where data in transit could be intercepted or modified, by protecting the data within encrypted TLS records.

## Learnings

This activity reinforced the critical importance of fundamental access controls and the severe risks posed by publicly exposed services. It highlighted how standard frameworks like NIST SP 800-30 provide a structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and communicating risks effectively. Furthermore, it emphasized the need to consider both external and internal threat vectors and the interconnectedness of vulnerabilities, threats, and business impact.
