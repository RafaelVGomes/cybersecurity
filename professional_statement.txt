I am a self-taught professional transitioning from software development to cybersecurity, driven by a deep commitment to ethical practices as a white-hat specialist.
My dedication stems from a strong determination to combat those who exploit the false anonymity of technology to harm others, especially skilled individuals who misuse their knowledge. I firmly believe cybersecurity fundamentally exists to safeguard people, their privacy, and digital trust. I aim to leverage my programming background, analytical skills, and ethical principles to help organizations effectively defend against digital threats.
