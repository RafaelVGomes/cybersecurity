## About Me

I am a dedicated cybersecurity professional with a background in software development, committed to ethical hacking and defending digital systems. This portfolio showcases my hands-on projects and skills acquired through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and other specialized trainings.

## Portfolio Structure

This repository is organized to highlight projects completed during my cybersecurity journey.

### Naming Convention

**Human-readable PDFs:** Project deliverables (reports, diagrams) are provided in PDF format with easy-to-read names (e.g., `PASTA Attack Tree.pdf`). These are for quick review by recruiters.

**Original Source Files (Linux Naming):** The editable source files (`.docx`, `.pptx`, etc.) are also included, named using the `lowercase_with_underscores.extension` convention (e.g., `pasta_attack_tree.pptx`). This demonstrates my adherence to common technical naming standards.
